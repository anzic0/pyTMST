# pyTMST

Python port of the [MATLAB TMST toolbox](https://github.com/LeoVarnet/TMST) by
LÃ©o Varnet. Currently a work in progress.

## Progress

Currently, the AMa and AMi spectra calculated by pyTMST have a maximum relative
floating point error of 5.e-2 and 1.e-3 compared to the TMST library when using
the first channel of the file `LaVoixHumaine_6s.wav` as a test signal. Note
that this does not mean that the results of the intermediate functions or
different test signals will give the same tolerance.

The f0 spectrum calculation is currently being worked on.

Compatibility with stereo signals will probably be implemented in the future.

## Installation

0. (optional) It is recommended to install the dependencies in a virtual
   environment dedicated to your project.
   1. Create a virtual environment
      ```
      python3 -m venv <env-name>
      ```
   2. Activate the virtual environment
      ```
      source <env-name>/bin/activate
      ```

1. Clone repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/anzic0/pyTMST
   ```
2. Change into the local repository directory
   ```
   cd pyTMST
   ```
3. Install requirements
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Install package
   ```
   pip install .
   ```

## Testing

To run the test script, the following MATLAB toolboxes must be put in a directory
called ```matlab_toolboxes```:
- [TMST](https://github.com/LeoVarnet/TMST)
- [Auditory Modelling Toolbox](https://amtoolbox.org/)
- [YIN](http://audition.ens.fr/adc/sw/yin.zip)

Furthermore, the [MATLAB Engine API for Python](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html)
corresponding to your local MATLAB version needs to be installed. For this, the
following steps may be followed:

1. Find the root directory of your MATLAB installation by running
   ```
   matlabroot
   ```
   in MATLAB
2. Change into the following subdirectory of the MATLAB root
   ```
   cd <matlab-root>/extern/engines/python
   ```
3. Install via pip
   ```
   python -m pip install .
   ```
